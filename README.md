## What is this?

Tree farm manager is a conceptual demo c++ application. The idea is that tree farm manager will be able to assist owners and managers of tree farms in their day to day tasks. Label and organize your plots, store info about each plot and implement your own api calls on button presses. For example, send a twillio (sms or whatsapp) reminder to the employees responsible for a certain task when the user (manager) presses an button on the application.
