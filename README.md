# Tree-Farm-Manager

This project uses glew version 2.2.0, freeglut version 3.2.2, and the latest soil version.
Freeglut and soil both need to be compiled using Cmake and run to get the lib files.

This is a conceptual demo application for an orginizational tool specifically designed towards assisting tree farms.
